The Dragonfly-N is a reliable, compact, and fully-digital system for neutron detection. Each unit is tested with a neutron source before leaving our facility.

This set includes a detector (high-sensitivity He-3) for a full turnkey system for detecting neutrons. Just connect to your computer through the included USB-C cable, open our software, and you're ready to go! 

The Dragonfly-N Includes: 

Charge-Sensitive Amp
P/Z Correction Stage 
Shaping Gain Stage 
Baseline Restore 
Single-Channel Analyzer 
High-Speed Digital Counter
